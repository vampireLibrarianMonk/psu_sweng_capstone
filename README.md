PROMPT: Now please through a series of code scaffolding, create 5 files from the top five programming languages which  have code vulnerabilities. Then create an llm inference tool to identify them and recommend changes.

To address your request, we'll proceed in two main steps:

Create Code Files with Vulnerabilities: We'll generate five code files, each in a different programming language, intentionally containing common security vulnerabilities.

Develop an LLM-Based Vulnerability Detection Tool: We'll outline how to create a tool that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify these vulnerabilities and recommend fixes.

Step 1: Creating Vulnerable Code Files

Based on common vulnerabilities in popular programming languages, here are examples for each:

PROMPT: Ok then lets create the llm vulnerability recommender from a model we can download from huggingface
