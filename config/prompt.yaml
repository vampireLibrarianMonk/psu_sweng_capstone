      **Address Unused Code:**
      - Refactor or remove unused functions and variables flagged by static analysis tools like Vulture to improve
          code maintainability and clarity:
      - Ensure the identified unused code is either integrated into the logic where appropriate or removed 
          entirely while preserving the script's intended functionality and maintaining code quality.
      - For functions or variables removed, ensure any related references, comments, or documentation are also 
          updated to maintain consistency.
     
      **Code Simplification:**
      - Regularly analyze the codebase for unused functions, variables, or imports, and remove them to keep the 
          code clean and efficient.
      - Combine related error-handling logic into fewer, well-documented functions to avoid redundancy and improve
          code reusability.
      - Maintain a balance between readability and efficiency by ensuring the code remains concise, modular, and 
          well-structured.

      **Ensure the code does not exceed {word_count} words or {line_count} lines.**

      **Only perform a one-for-one replacement for the method provided, do not write additional methods.**
                
      **Include only the code with appropriate docstrings and inline comments.**

      **Never hard code credentials, keys, or sensitive data.** 
      Retrieve them securely from environment variables, configuration files, or external services. Avoid embedding 
      sensitive data directly in code. When automating with tools like SSH, pass sensitive data through environment 
      variables (e.g., using 'sshpass --env' for passwords) to prevent exposure in command-line arguments. Ensure 
      temporary sensitive data is cleared from memory or the environment immediately after use. Avoid using variable 
      names containing 'password' or similar terms for storing sensitive data.
       
      **Ensure that all environment variables are checked after loading to guarantee they are not `None` and match the 
        expected data type.**
      - Use explicit type conversion (e.g., `int()`, `float()`, `str()`) to ensure the values conform to the required 
        type and handle potential conversion errors gracefully.
      - When type conversion is performed, validate the converted value to ensure it meets functional requirements (e.g.
        , range checks for numeric values).
      - If an environment variable is required but not set, log an appropriate error and terminate execution or provide
      a fallback value where applicable.
      - Structured data formats such as JSON and YAML should be read from files rather than being passed directly 
        through environment variables. This ensures maintainability, security, and consistency in configuration 
        management. Paths to these configuration files may be set as environment variables, but the structured content 
        itself must be loaded from disk at runtime.

      **Validate and Sanitize Inputs:**  
      - Ensure all inputs, including filenames and environment variables, are validated for existence, format, and type
        before use.  
      - Use `Path.resolve()` for filesystem paths to prevent directory traversal vulnerabilities.  
      - Convert dynamically loaded values explicitly (`int()`, `str()`, etc.) to maintain consistency and prevent 
        unexpected behavior.  
      
      **Enforce Type Safety:**  
      - Apply strict type annotations to all functions, ensuring return types are consistent and non-optional unless 
        explicitly required.  
      - Replace ambiguous return types (`Optional[X]`) with defaults or explicit exceptions to prevent runtime errors.  

      **Define Method Signatures:**
      - Use explicit type annotations for all parameters and return values; ensure that both parameter types and return 
      types are specified for every function and method.
      - Employ clear and descriptive parameter names.
      - Specify specific non-vague types; avoid `object` or invalid types such as `any`. Use `typing.Any` where 
      generality is required.
      - Include any relevant constraints or modifiers.
      - Ensure that default values in method signatures match the expected type to avoid type mismatches and improve 
      type safety.
      - If a function is intended to always return a specific type (e.g., `float` or `str`), provide appropriate 
      fallback values in cases of exceptions or errors to maintain consistency in the return type. For instance, if 
      `None` is not a valid return value, ensure that a default value (e.g., an empty string or 0) is returned instead.
      - When working with dynamically loaded values (e.g., from environment variables), account for their potential 
      type variations and validate or convert them appropriately to prevent type-related issues.
      - Avoid ambiguous return types that include optional values (`Optional[X]`) when the function is expected to 
      always return a specific type. Instead, handle cases where the value might be `None` or invalid by either 
      raising an appropriate exception or substituting with a sensible default value.
      - Ensure that error handling within methods does not result in incompatible or inconsistent return types. Always 
      align return types with the function's type annotations to improve reliability and maintainability.
      
      **Additional Guidance for Input Validation:**
      - For functions handling multiple types of input (e.g., strings, bytes), provide overloading of function 
      signatures using `@overload` from `typing`. For example, create distinct overload signatures for each valid input 
      type and ensure that the return type matches the input format.
      - In cases where strict input typing is required, handle conversions and validations within the function body 
      while enforcing correct types in the function signature.
      - Address discrepancies in type expectations by documenting potential input types and ensuring the function either
      handles multiple types internally or raises exceptions if an unsupported type is provided.

      **Ensure Exception Handling:**
      - Always ensure that `raise` statements are nested within structured exception blocks, such as 
          `try...except`.
      - Propagate original exceptions/errors to maintain traceback information; avoid re-raising exceptions as 
          different types.
      - **Avoid using print statements or logging within exception/error blocks.**
      - **Never return `None`;** instead, raise appropriate exceptions or provide meaningful return values.
      - Handle unexpected input types by:
        - Validating input types at the function's start.
        - Raising a `TypeError` for inappropriate argument types.
        - Raising a `ValueError` for arguments with correct types but inappropriate values.
        - Providing clear, informative error messages to facilitate debugging.

      **Ensure Accurate Docstrings:**
      - Clearly describe the function's purpose, parameters, return types, and exceptions raised.
      - Follow standard conventions for clarity and consistency.
                                
      **Ensure adequate logging is implemented.**
      
      **Ensure a main method is implemented for standalone running capability:**
      - The `main` method should initialize and orchestrate the execution of the program's functionality.
      - Include appropriate logging within the `main` method to track execution and identify issues.
      - Ensure the `main` method is invoked when the script is executed directly.

      Please review and refactor the following Python code. Focus on:

      1. Abstracting redundant logic to improve maintainability.
      2. Implementing structured error handling to manage unexpected input types:
         - Address exceptions specific to the method's functionality first.
         - Handle exceptions from associated libraries next.
         - Finally, address general exceptions, preserving their original types and messages.
      3. Ensuring a main method is implemented for standalone running capability:
         - The `main` method should initialize and orchestrate the execution of the program's functionality.
         - Include appropriate logging within the `main` method to track execution and identify issues.
         - Ensure the `main` method is invoked when the script is executed directly.

      Avoid altering behavior or introducing additional variables. Use concise comments to explain critical modifications:

      {method_code}
      
      ### Test Type:
      {description}
      
      ## Tested Methods:
      1. Don't create new methods assume input methods to test will be prepended into the file.
      
      ### Test Naming & Structure:
      1. **Test Names:** Clearly reflect test type and method purpose.
      3. **Assertions:** Validate outcomes using relevant checks.
      4. **Setup & Teardown:** Use setup and cleanup steps to handle dependencies and mock data.
      5. **Isolation:** Ensure tests do not share state by managing resources independently.
      
      ### Temporary File Handling:
      1. **Temporary Files:** Use `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` or `tmp_path` (pytest fixture) for test-specific 
      temporary files.
         - When using `NamedTemporaryFile`, ensure the `delete=False` argument is set if you need to access the file 
      outside of its context.
         - Use context management (`with` statement) to handle file creation and automatic cleanup when possible.
      
      2. **File Modes:** Match the file mode to the data being written or read to prevent encoding errors.
         - Use text mode (`'w'` or `'r'`) for JSON and other textual data.
         - Use binary mode (`'wb'` or `'rb'`) for non-textual data, such as serialized objects or byte streams.
      
      3. **Data Writing and Reading:** 
         - Write and read data using appropriate methods for the file mode (e.g., `write()` for text, `write(b'...')` 
      for binary).
         - Avoid mixing modes, such as writing bytes to a file opened in text mode.
      
      4. **Error Handling:** Validate method behavior under file-related exceptions, such as `FileNotFoundError` or 
      `PermissionError`.
         - Use mock objects to simulate file access errors in unit tests.
      
      5. **Log Capturing:** Implement custom log handlers or pytest's built-in `caplog` fixture to capture and assert 
      log messages generated during file operations.
      
      ### Test Method Signatures:
      1. **Relevant Parameters:** Include only necessary parameters in the test method signature. Avoid unused 
      parameters such as pytest fixtures (e.g., `tmp_path`) if they are not utilized within the method body.
      2. **Descriptive Naming:** Ensure test method names clearly describe the purpose and behavior being tested, 
      helping to identify the test's intent at a glance.
      3. **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent structure across test methods, using meaningful parameters that align 
      with the test's setup, execution, and assertions.
      4. **Fixture Usage:** If a pytest fixture is required, declare it in the method signature. However, if no 
      fixture-specific operations are performed, remove it to prevent confusion and maintain cleaner code.

      ### Type Safety, Input Validation & Method Signatures:
      1. **Strict Type Annotations:** Apply explicit parameter and return type annotations to all methods to ensure 
      clarity and prevent ambiguity.
      2. **Validation:** 
         - Validate input types at the beginning of each method.
         - Convert inputs as necessary, raising `TypeError` or `ValueError` for unsupported or invalid values.
         - Avoid ambiguous types (`Optional[X]`) unless necessary. Provide default values or raise exceptions instead.
      3. **Consistent Returns:** Ensure methods consistently return a defined type.
         - Avoid returning `None`. Raise exceptions for errors or provide meaningful defaults instead.
         - Align method behavior with return type annotations to maintain type safety and prevent inconsistencies.
      4. **Explicit Parameter and Return Types:** Define all parameters and return values explicitly to avoid ambiguity.
         - Avoid using vague types like `object`. Use `typing.Any` only when absolutely necessary.
         - Ensure that parameter default values match their type annotations.
      5. **Dynamic Value Handling:** Validate or convert dynamically loaded or runtime-injected values.
         - Use Python’s `@overload` decorator from the `typing` module to provide precise type hints for methods with 
      multiple valid input types.
     
      ### Exception Handling:
      1. **Structured Try-Except Blocks:** Use `try-except` to catch and handle exceptions while preserving the original
      context.
         - For expected errors, provide a clear, descriptive message and raise a new exception using the `from` clause 
      to retain traceback information.
         - Avoid suppressing unexpected exceptions unless necessary, and always log or re-raise them to aid in 
      debugging.
      
      2. **Input Validation:** Validate inputs at the start of methods to catch and handle errors early.
         - Raise appropriate exceptions such as `TypeError` or `ValueError` with clear, informative messages when inputs
      are invalid.
         - Ensure that exceptions clearly distinguish between different failure scenarios (e.g., invalid data vs. 
      missing resources) to improve error handling in calling code.
      
      3. **Error Context Preservation:** 
         - Use exception chaining (`raise ... from e`) to provide both the original and re-raised exception details.
         - This allows for better debugging and error tracing by maintaining a full stack trace of the error's origin.
      
      4. **Consistent Exception Types:** Raise exceptions that accurately reflect the error's nature.
         - Avoid raising generic exceptions like `Exception`; instead, use or define specific exception classes 
      (`FileNotFoundError`, `ValueError`, etc.).
         - This ensures that consumers of the method can handle specific exceptions without ambiguity.
      
      ### Documentation & Logging:
      1. **Docstrings:** Explain each method's purpose, parameters, return type, and exceptions.
      2. **Logging:** Add meaningful logging for execution tracking and issue diagnosis.
      
      ### Execution:
      1. **Main Method:** Use `pytest.main()` for automated test discovery and execution.
      2. **Efficiency:** Keep tests concise, avoiding redundancy to ensure fast execution.
