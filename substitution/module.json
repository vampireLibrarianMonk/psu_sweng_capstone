{
    "os.system": "Remove the os.system module and implement another module's function that validates user input against a predefined set of allowed commands (e.g., 'ls', 'mkdir', 'rm', 'cp') and executes them using the 'sh' module.",
    "subprocess": "Refrain from any usage of the subprocess module. For file and directory operations, utilize Python's built-in os and shutil modules. For running system commands, use the sh module to implement sh.Command(command)(*args) or getattr(sh, command)(*args) for dynamically executing a validated command with arguments, while relying on the command's direct invocation and handling errors with sh.ErrorReturnCode for robust and safe execution. For network-related tasks like ICMP operations, the ping3 library offers a pure Python implementation for sending ping requests without relying on system commands.",
    "pickle": "Replace the pickle module with the json module for serialization and deserialization. JSON handles basic data types securely and doesn't execute arbitrary code during deserialization, reducing the risk of code injection attacks.",
    "tempfile": "Avoid hardcoding directory paths for temporary files. Instead, utilize the module's default behavior, which automatically selects a secure and appropriate directory for temporary files based on your system's environment.",
    "flask": "Always add `instance_relative_config=True` in `Flask` constructor to allow load configurations from an instance folder for environment-specific or sensitive settings."
